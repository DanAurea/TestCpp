This is a test for a C++ application using Qt/VTK/ITK.

ITK is used for Image Processing.
VTK is used for Mesh Processing.
QT is used for UI and files management.

- Install environment following instructions in Install.pdf. You need VS2017. ExternalLibs are compiled in Release mode only and should be installed on the system.

- The goal of this application is to load a pre-segmented CT scan of the shoulder. The data are provided separately in Zip file.

1) Select and read folder to find images
2) Read all Images using ITK - itkImageFileReader
3) Build a 3D VTK Volume to display the 2D images in Qt view using VTK - vtkImageData
4) Segment data to build the 3D meshes - itkBinaryImageThresholdFilter - vtkMarchingCubes
5) Display the 3D meshes in 3D view - vtkMapper - vtkActor
